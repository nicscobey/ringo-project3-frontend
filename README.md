# Flashcards App

The front-end of the Flashcard App allows a user to create a deck of flashcards, pulling word definitions from an API, and review the definitions of a deck through a practice interface. The application features full CRUD (create, read ,update, and delete) functionality for the deck model and partial CRUD (create, read, and delete) for the card model. Users can create, read, update, and delete a deck of cards. Additionally, they can create, read, and delete cards that are assigned to a given deck.
